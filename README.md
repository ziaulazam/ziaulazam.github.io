## Usage

You can can edit the yml files and replace the demo content with your own. Hopefully it will be fairly simple to work out where all the content goes, but here is a quick overview.

##### _config.yml
This will contain all the of the main configuration for your resume such as your name, email, social media links and about me content. It will also allow you to change the titles of some of the content sections.
A full example of the _config.yml can be found [here](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme/blob/master/_config.yml)

##### Dark Mode
Dark mode is configured via _config.yml
```
darkmode: true (options: true, false, never)
```
When dark mode is `true` the site will show the dark theme for everyone
When dark mode is `false` the site will not show the dark theme, but it will still respect the users device preferences
When dark mode is `never` the site will never be shown in the dark theme

## Running locally

Before you start make sure you have *Ruby* and the gems for *Jekyll* and *Bundler* installed locally.
You can do that by running: `gem install jekyll bundler`

1. Clone your resume repository locally *(if you haven't already)*
2. `cd [your-repository-name]`
3. `bundle install`
4. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:4000`

Any changes you make will automatically build and you will be able to see these by refreshing your browser.

*Note: You will need to re-run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to see changes made in `_config.yml`.*
