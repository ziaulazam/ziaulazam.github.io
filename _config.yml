  Hi, I'm Zia. I am a software engineer with over **5 years** of industry experience. I have worked professionally on software products that are being used to design state of the art microprocessors and visualize 3D point cloud data and complex CAD geometries.

  I love working on software systems where **performance** and **scalability** are essential. I have worked mainly with <mark>C++</mark> in my professional career but I have also worked with various other programming languages like <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>JavaScript</mark> to accomplish other code generation, scripting tools and user interface development tasks.

  I am passionate about **software performance engineering**, **computer security** and **learning about computing from first principles**.
